    "- This process leads to a *model*, which is a set of equations that allows scientists to isolate and understand the principles of the system under investigation.\n",
    "- Thus, the goal of building models is not to replicate *exactly* the system under investigation, but instead to identify a simplified and low-dimensional representation that can be understood by humans or simulated by computers.\n",
    "- On the other hand, models should be sufficiently generic that they can be applied to different datasets.  This means that the models must be flexible enough that they can be adjusted to different datasets without having to create a brand new model for each particular dataset.\n",
    "- This is why models contain both *fixed features* and *free parameters*.\n",
    "  - The fixed features are components of the model that the scientist imposes, based on scientific evidence, theories, and intuition.\n",
    "  - Free parameters are varaibles that can be adjusted to allow the model to fit any particular dataset.\n",
    "- This brings us to the primary goal of model-fitting: find values for these free parameters that make the model match the data as closely as possible."
