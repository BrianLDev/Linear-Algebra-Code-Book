    "A few remarks about indicating complex numbers in writing:\n",
    "1. Complex numbers are always written using the real part first.\n",
    "2. In between the two components could be a space, a comma, or a plus or minus sign.  You might also see square brackets, parentheses, or nothing around the numbers.  Variations include [a bi], (a,bi), [a+bi], a bi.\n",
    "3. z is the go-to letter to indicate a complex number: z = a+ib.  After that, w is the next best thing.\n",
    "4. You cna position the i before or after the imaginary component: [a bi] or [a ib].\n",
    "5. Most people use i to indicate the imaginary operator. Engineers tend to use j because they use i for electrical current.  *On the other hand, engineers write handwritten notes in ALL CAPS and start coungin at 0, so let's not be too quick to adopt all engineering practices.*\n",
    "6. To avoid embarrassment at math parties, be careful to distinguish the following terms:\n",
    "  - **Complex number:**  A number that contains two parts, a real and imaginary, like in the notational varieties above.\n",
    "  - **Imaginary number:** A complex number with no real part [0+ib] = ib.\n",
    "  - **Imaginary operator:** The symbol (i or j) that represents the square root of minus one, without any other numbers attached to it.\n",
    "  - **Imaginary component:** This is the real number that multiplies the imaginary operator.  In the number a+ib, the imaginary component is b, not ib!  Geometrically, this corresponds to the distance on the y-axis on a complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why complex numbers are so useful is that they pack a lot of information into a compact representation.  "
