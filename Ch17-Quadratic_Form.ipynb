    "2. The goal of this code challenge is to explore the definiteness of random-integer matrices.  Start by writing code that generates a 4x4 matrix of random integers between -10 and +10, and that has all real-valued eigenvalues.  You *could* solve this by multiplying the matrix by its transpose, but that would limit the possibilities of definiteness categories.  Thus, continue creating random matrices until all 4 eigenvalues are real-valued.  Next, compute the definiteness category of the matrix.\n",
